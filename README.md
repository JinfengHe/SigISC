# Significance-based Interpretable Sequence Clustering(SigISC)


## Running
The dataset in folder dataset is the original labeled dataset and the dataset in folder dataset_unlabeled is the unlabeled dataset.
1. Change the file path in PatternMining.py to the file path of the dataset in the folder dataset_unlabeled.
2. Change the file path in SigISC.py to the file path of the dataset in the folder dataset.
3. Run SigISC.py to get the clustering results.
